			An analysis on the Politics of Stairs
		</p>
		<p>
			The paper is really The paper is really interesting, and it managed to get me thinking about the topics it covers, mainly what should be considered "dos" and "dont's" when it comes to stairs. What I got from skimming is that if you want to make people use stairs, don't bully them into it; encourage them by basically making it interesting to take the stairs without discriminating against anyone who doesn't want to or can't.
		</p>

			I like the idea of the "irresistible staircase" or preferred staircases. They use pull strategy (aesthetics, information, and sensory appeal), to make someone want to go somewhere, but without forcing them to if they are unable to go there. Similarly, it’s not a good idea to put the elevator at the back of the building and to lock the elevator keycard. Instead, you should give equal access and appeal to people to use the most energy-efficient transport method available, so you don't discriminate against people who need accessibility options, unintentionally or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			I honestly think this is super interesting, having read the full article now. For example, the article asks, "What if we install different vertical circulation elements, like ramps—not as an afterthought, but as a central design strategy?" This is a super cool idea to me, the idea of intentionally designing multiple accessible methods of up-or-down transport into the design itself, instead of just going, ‘Oh, yeah, accessibility is kind of lacking, here's a poorly installed ramp, I guess.’ I like that idea. Let's say you had an art museum. If you were forward-thinking, you could commission a piece to attach to a ramp and work with it so it could look like, for example, people walking up a river's rapids or something, compared to just installing a ramp normally.
		</p>
		<p>
			Overall, I think this article has a lot of good ideas, and I think a lot of people, especially in those positions where they would be designing buildings, should read it since it talks about things that should be discussed.
