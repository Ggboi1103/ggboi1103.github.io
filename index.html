					I dunno, this exists
				</h2>
			<p>
				I made this site, originally, to fufill a requirement for a college assignment, but now it's just my website so now i do whatever with it

				<h2>

			In it's current form, I will be using this website as a sort of 'personal-use publicly hosted file sharing thingy'. Don't really worry about anything you find here; it's probably not related to what led you here.
			</h2>
		<p>
			Seriously, don't worry about it. This is JUST a place for me to host files that other sites don't like, like if Discord won't accept it for file size, or if Twitter (or x) won't like it's length, or something
		</p>
			<h2>
				Thank you for coming to my ted talk

			...i dunno man, making stuff is fun but it can be hard
