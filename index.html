				<h2>
					Page 1: The average News Article
				</h2>
			<p>
				Basically, it's a pretend version of a lot of online news sites these days. It isn't the best, but that's beacuse I don't know how to make it like they do; I'm just me.
			</p>
				<h2>
					Page 2: The Cookbook
				</h2>
			<p>
				Basically, my take on those "cookbook" sites that tell you "here's how to make this good sounding food!" and then, before you can actually get to the instructions, you have to scroll through their 2000 page 'about me' since that's definitally why you're on that site, right?

		<article>
			<h2>
			Page 3: The rant
			</h2>
		<p>
			I made this page so I could have an excuse to write a couple paragraphs about my thoughts on web design under the guise of a parody of someone who made a page just to rant about some topic or other.
		</p>
			<h2>
				Page 4: The finale.
			</h2>
		<p>
			The final page, where I tell you about the stuff I learned in this class.
