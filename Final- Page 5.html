			<h2>Hello again! </h2>
			<p>
				it's been a ride, hasn't it? I mean, this was a lot of fun. HTML is a skill i'll likely be able to use in a lot of places, depending on where I go in life. So, I thank you for helping me get aquire these new skills. If I could change one thing, I would probably go back and redo all of my projects with the knowledge I have now, as well as making sure I got every detail from all of the available resources.

		<p>Some things I've learned in this final assignment:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>how to use float</li>
			<li>how to use stylepages</li>
			<li>better CSS usage</li>
			<li>how to have multiple columns per page</li>
			<li>blockquote</li>
		</ul>
		A final thought: I'm still figuring this whole college thing out; I'm still technically in high school. PSEO is an amazing resource, but that doesn't mean it's easy by any means. So, this might not be perfect, but I'm happy with it.
