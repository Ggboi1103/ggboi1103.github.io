			<h2>Hello again! </h2>
			<p>
				it's been a ride, hasn't it? I mean, this was a lot of fun. HTML is a skill i'll likely be able to use in a lot of places, depending on where I go in life. So, I thank you for helping me get aquire these new skills. If I could change one thing, I would probably go back and redo all of my projects with the knowledge I have now, as well as making sure I got every detail from all of the available resources.
